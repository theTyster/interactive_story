<h1><a href="https://portfolio.thetyster.dev">Welcome to My Portfolio!</a></h1>

My portfolio started out as a single project called The Duck Story. ðŸ¦†

As I began my journey into web development, this little project became a place where I could practice using Javascript to manipulate elements on a webpage.
<a href="https://github.com/theTyster/duck_story/releases/tag/1.0.0">Version 1</a> of the story was about 600 lines of static JavaScript. Characters were made with ascii art in \<pre\> tags.
It walked the user through one branch of the story and had almost no animations and very little illustrations.
It really was just about learning the code.

Now, it is transforming into a full-blown react app.

I have numerous more projects I made during my bootcamp with Springboard as well as some personal projects that I have taken on to contribute to the world of web development and open source code.
