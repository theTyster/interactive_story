			<h2>Hi there!</h2>
			<p>I can see that you don't have JavaScript enabled.</p>
			<p>That's totally cool. I actually typically browse with JavaScript disabled myself.</p>
			<p>Maybe you're like me and you care a lot about privacy and like to <b>know</b> before hand what kind of code you are executing before you visit a page.</p>
			<p>If that's the case, you can see the code for this site <a href="https://github.com/theTyster/portfolio">here</a>.</p>
			<h2>What's that? It's something else?</h2>
			<p>No worries! Let's check a few things.</p>
			<ol>
				<li><a href="https://browsehappy.com">Is your browser up to date?</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://enable-javascript.com">Did you accidentally disable JavaScript?</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://whatismybrowser.com">Do you wan't to try a different browser?</a></li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Whatever the case is...</h3>
			<p>You will eventually need JavaScript enabled to view this site. I'm a web developer and my portfolio is an expos√© on the things I can do with JavaScript, so I am afraid there is no way around that.</p>
			<p>Thanks for taking time to view my site!</p>
